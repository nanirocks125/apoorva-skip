| NFR-18 | Ease of use | New bill ≤ 2 taps from any tab; any feature ≤ 1 tap from a tab | Centre tab + More menu + universal search |
| NFR-19 | Permission correctness | Role limits enforced even if the UI is bypassed | Firestore rules are authoritative |

**MVP minimum bar:** which NFRs are Must / Should / Later for the Store MVP, the relaxed pilot targets, and how each is verified are in [11 — NFR MVP baseline](11-nfr-mvp-baseline.md). Where a target there differs from this table (for example sync p95 and crash-free users), the MVP bar applies until M4.

## Sync model (summary)
1. Every write goes to SQLite with `syncState = pending`.
2. Outbox worker pushes pending rows in batches; on success marks `synced`.
3. Firestore snapshot listeners pull remote changes into SQLite.
4. Conflicts resolved per NFR-04; conflicting bills are flagged for review, never silently dropped.

## Out of scope (v1)
Payment gateway integration, e-invoicing IRN, multi-currency, hardware POS terminals.
